# arma3-155mm-artillery-calculator

This repository is a ballistic calculator for the M4 Scorcher, the most commonly used self-propelled artillery in Arma 3. 

Normally, it is not necessary because a ballistic computer can be used, but it is a ballistic calculator that can be used in cases where low-angle shelling is desired or the use of a ballistic computer is prohibited. 

Due to the limitations of the Python sympy module and other reasons, the currently supported range is as follows.

Range: 1400m ~ 29900m

Charge-level: 1~3

angle: only low angle elevation
