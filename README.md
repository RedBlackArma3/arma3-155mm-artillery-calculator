# arma3-155mm-artillery-calculator

This repository is a ballistic calculator for the M4 Scorcher, the most commonly used self-propelled artillery in Arma 3. 

Normally, it is not necessary because a ballistic computer can be used, but it is a ballistic calculator that can be used in cases where low-angle shelling is desired or the use of a ballistic computer is prohibited.
